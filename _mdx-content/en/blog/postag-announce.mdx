## About

[Postag](https://postag.hobo.wtf/) -- service for aggregating posts from popular frontend blogs in one place. For now it grabs fresh posts every Sunday.

## Motivation

As for now there is a lot of noise on development topics. I wanted to see for updates on authors I like and the leaders of the industry.

## Technical

It is pretty simple now: React frontend, Express backend, Cheerio for crawling, cron for scheduling.

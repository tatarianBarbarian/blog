[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) format is Markdown Extended. It is a way to make content more interactive.

While we compile our Markdown to HTML, MDX compiles to JSX.
And yes, it is possible to use React components here.
There are actually three commonly used solutions for MDX with Next.js:

- [@next/mdx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/mdx)
- [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote)
- [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler)

Basically, they all can compile our MDX. But the devil is in the details. In addition to compilation, we may need some functionality such as:

- [frontmatter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/) extraction
- handle imports, because [we can use JavaScript imports in MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/#esm)
- substitute default HTML elements to custom ones. For example swap `<h1>{:jsx}` with `<CustomH1Heading>{:jsx}`

## @next/mdx

This is what Next.js docs [recommends](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/using-mdx) us by default.

Usage scenarios:

- Pages as MDX
- Import MDX (and whatever MDX exports) from JS/TS files
- React components imports inside MDX

I created an example repo with some of them for better understanding.

[Example repo with @next/mdx](https://github.com/tatarianBarbarian/nextjs-with-next-mdx)

Also available in sandbox:

Give it some clicks.

### Reflections on @next/mdx

I tried to take it to my blog, but I found that it is bound to filesystem and I'll end up with some boilerplate code.

This is a good solution if:

- You don't need to "compile" it by yourself
- Your MDX comes from filesystem
- Your routes are filesystem-based, not [dynamic](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes) ones

## next-mdx-remote

Main focus of this project is to awoid @next/mdx [limitations](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote#background--theory).

It offers us different approach. It gives us ability to compile our MDX files in
[getStaticProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-static-props)
or [getServerSideProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)

[Example repo with next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/tatarianBarbarian/next-js-with-next-mdx-remote)

In sandbox:

<iframe
  frameBorder="0"
  width="100%"
  height="500px"
  src="https://replit.com/@asssama212/next-js-with-next-mdx-remote?embed=true"
/>

As you can see, we can swap standard components with ours.

Cool thing is that it also can parse frontmatter!

`import{:js}`/`export{:js}` don't work in next-mdx-remote. If we want to use some components from our codebase,
we should provide them through "components" property of `<MDXRemote>{:jsx}` component.

### Reflections on next-mdx-remote

It was "almost this" for my own purposes, but absence of handling imports was critical for me.

This one is good solution if:

- You have many and many MDX files
- Your MDX may be anywhere
- You know the set of components which will be used in MDX

## mdx-bundler

I don't know why but it took me some time to find it actually.

It's like next-mdx-remote, but with batteries. It has very similar interface but:

- handles import/export statements inside our MDX
- you can reference frontmatter inside MDX itself
- you can reference constants declared in your MDX

[Example repo with mdx-bundler](https://github.com/tatarianBarbarian/next-js-with-mdx-bundler)

Example code in sanbox:

<iframe
  frameBorder="0"
  width="100%"
  height="500px"
  src="https://replit.com/@asssama212/next-js-with-mdx-bundler?embed=true"
/>

### Reflections on mdx-bundler

It has simple and flexible API. But its abilities terrifying me a bit.

And this is why: we can write entire components inside our MDX, can import and export things.

It's very easy to fall into situation where **our content is highly coupled to our code**.

## Summary

Which tool is the coolest?

The coolest one that meets your requirements.

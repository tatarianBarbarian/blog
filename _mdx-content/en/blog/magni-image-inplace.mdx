Got knocked down by COVID, so work was hard for me and doing nothing was even harder.
I was browsing ebay, and common UI widget with magnifying image got my eye.
So I decided to re-create it, and it resulted in an npm package.

## The result

It is web-component based wrapper for images. Framework agnostic.

Works with
[React](https://codesandbox.io/s/magni-image-inplace-react-example-8cox6),
[Vue](https://codesandbox.io/s/magni-image-inplace-vue-example-gvehq),
and technically should work with any others.

[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/magni-image-inplace)

### Browsers support

Predominantly major versions because it uses
[slots](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot)
and [::slotted selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/CSS/::slotted)

## What I got

Invented the bicycle, but it was funny.

Learned more about `vite`, `github-pages`, `web-components`.

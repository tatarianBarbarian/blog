excerpt: 'How do you choose tools for certain problems?'
---

I'll try to explain it by using system thinking techniques and questions to yourself.

## Identify problem

All tools are solving certain problems.
So the first right step is correctly identify problem.

Ask yourself:

- What problem I'm going to solve?
- Is it actually a problem and should I solve it?
- Can I [avoid](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/don-t-solve-problems-eliminate-them) this problem?
- Can I split this problem into smaller ones?
- Can I solve this natively without using any 3rd party tools?

## Choose a tool

Or build it by yourself!

Good example from UI-development is [datepicker](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/getting-started/)
implementation.

We can build this picker by ourselwes, which will produce a set of sub-problems.

In most cases component part will require API design, and solve such problems as positioning, drop-downs and input masking.
Internal part will require solution for working with dates and i18n.

Also we can use opensource solution. It will require learning documentation and to accept some restrictions.

There is no right answer -- all depends on your budget, requirements and skills.

The thing is that you need to understand your problem, possible solutions, trade-offs.

## Try to build mental model of the tool by recreating it in your head

So, in most cases you'll choose opensource tools.

It feels a lot better when our tools aren't just black boxes that do some magic for us.

It simplifies understanding of the tool, makes easier to find bugs, avoid patching and create workarounds.

Ask yourself:

- If I made it by myself from scratch how did it work?
- What it should be based on?
- Which hierarchy, structure, entitites it would have?

## Understand data flow/lifecycle

What is the best place for fetching data in React? And in Vue?
Refetching data in both of them?

While both tools are solving the same problem, they are different.

Questions:

- When and where should I pass the inputs?
- How to manipulate data?
- How to get output?
- Does it have lifecycle hooks or events to react on certain things?
- Error handling?
- Plug-ins, modifications?
- How to debug and test?

## Pull it all together

All above things should lead you to understanding:

- What problem we are going to solve
- What are possible native and 3rd party solutions
- What concept/technology/pattern stands behind the solution
- How it lives, accepts inputs and produces outputs

### Examples

It's very good if you can formulate your knowledge about tool in a set of sentences.

As you learning the tool, this sentences should become more detalized.

There is couple of rough examples:

**GraphQL**

Query language for working with API.

Someone call it unified interface to API.

Which problems solves:

- universal language to speak with API
- avoiding overfetching, i.e. get only data you need
- build a contract between frontend and backend

Entities: _Query_, _Mutation_, _Type_, _Schema_.

---

**Typescript**

A subset of javascript which offers type definitions and compile-time type checking.

Which problems solves:

- ability to type variables and functions
- ability to model our own data types
- check validity of our types at compile time

Main concepts are: _Types_, _Interfaces_, _Generics_. Allows to define types of the variables.

Doesn't check types at the **run time**

---

**Three.js**

Basically the tool for building 3d experiences in web.

Which problems solves:

- work with 3d objects
- animate 3d objects
- build interactive interfaces with 3d objects

Uses WebGL for computations and canvas for output(in most cases).

Typical Three.js app consists of _Scene_, which is composition of _Objects_, _Cameras_, _Groups_, _Meshes_.

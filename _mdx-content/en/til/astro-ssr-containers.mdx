Astro has a SSR mode with some of the adapters, which makes Astro output not just
a set of HTML pages, but Node.js server which generates HTML on every request.

There is one thing to consider if you deploy it to Fly.io or Azure Web Apps environments -- don't forget to add `HOST=0.0.0.0` environment variable in run command.

In my case, it was `start` script in `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "start": "HOST=0.0.0.0 node ./dist/server/entry.mjs"
}
```

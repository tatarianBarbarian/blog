excerpt: 'Weird behavior of testing Formik with happy-dom'

## Problem

I was trying to test simple authentication [form](https://github.com/tatarianBarbarian/fancy-auth).

The stack was: React, Vite, Vitest, happy-dom.

I don't know why, but formik inputs weren't reacting on `userEvent.type{:js}`, `userEvent.click{:js}` methods.

Formik form didn't submit.

There is not much info if you just try to google the issue.

Problem seemed to be with `userEvent{:js}`, because with `fireEvent{:js}` it was partially working.
But in guides `userEvent{:js}` seemed to be working fine!

## Solution

The root of issue was in `happy-dom{:sh}` package, which can be selected as an environment option for Vitest.

So, moving from:

```js
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  base: '',
  plugins: [react()],
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: 'happy-dom',
    setupFiles: './src/test/setup.js',
  },
})
```

to:

```js
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  base: '',
  plugins: [react()],
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: 'jsdom',
    setupFiles: './src/test/setup.js',
  },
})
```

has solved the issue.

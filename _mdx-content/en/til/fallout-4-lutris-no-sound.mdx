## Problem

I was running Fallout 4 from Lutris under `lutris-GE-Proton7-37{:bash}` runner.

There were some sounds, but not all of them: no background music, no charactar replics.

Problem is common, and there actualy was a
[solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamPlay/comments/jf3ndq/comment/g9iofke/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

But it was for Steam and Proton, my problem was with Lutris.

First thing I tried is just simply to run something like this:

```bash
WINEPREFIX=~/path_to_game_prefix/ WINEDLLOVERRIDES="xaudio2_7=n,b" wine ~/path_to_fallout4.exe
```

It didn't work for me, and this is why: I was running my <u>local Wine installation</u>.

To make it work I needed to run it under `lutris-GE-Proton7-37{:bash}` installation.

So the working command was:

```bash
WINEPREFIX=~/path_to_game_prefix/ \
WINEDLLOVERRIDES="xaudio2_7=n,b" \
~/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/lutris-GE-Proton7-37-x86_64/bin/wine \
~/path_to_fallout4.exe
```

Also there is another way to set override:

```bash
WINEPREFIX=~/path_to_game_prefix/ \
~/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/lutris-GE-Proton7-37-x86_64/bin/winecfg
```

And then go to `Libraries{:bash}` tab, and set `xaudio2_6{:bash}` and `xaudio2_7{:bash}` to `"native, then built in"{:bash}`.

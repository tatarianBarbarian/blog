## General outline

There is a script that should run on some schedule.

The script is type of run-once-then-shutdown.

Script is pretty simple, here are some of the core components:

- `dotenv` for environment variables
- `pino` for logging
- `firebase-admin` for some db logic

### Script logic

1. Initialize env
2. Do some db stuff
3. Shut down
4. Repeat when cron will invoke script again

### Crontab

```crontab
1 0 * * * /path/to/node /path/to/script.js >> /path/to/log 2>&1
```

`>> /path/to/log 2>&1{:sh}` will say cron to write any output from script to a file

## What can go wrong?

### No MTA installed, discarding output

This record can be found in `/var/log/syslog` right after our cron job.

It is the signal that we probably have an error in our script.

Make sure that you specified the outputs for cron job.

I mean `>> /path/to/log 2>&1{:sh}`.

### The "path" argument must be of type string. Received undefined

It happens when our code relies on paths, that are specified in `.env` file:

- path to firebase creds
- path to logs
- etc.

To make sure `dotenv` loads `.env` file correctly we need to specify it in `.config` method.

In my case env initialization was in `app-root/lib/config.js{:sh}`, and env file was in `app-root` folder.

This worked for me:

`require('dotenv').config({path: __dirname + '../.env'}){:js}`

See [https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#path](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#path)

## Recommendations

Consider of using absolute paths in `.env{:js}` file

Also keep in mind that `path.resolve(){:js}` method uses `process.cwd(){:js}` as a base path.
To be sure everything is fine it would be a good idea to use `__dirname` variable as a base, so
`path.resolve(__dirname, '../'){:js}` can be better than simply `path.resolve('..'){:js}`

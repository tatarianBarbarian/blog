## The problem

On one of the projects we were moving our Next.js + Firebase app to Vercel.

In old flow we pushed environment variables via bash script and `export` directive.
In a new flow we decided to use Vercel's env variables and encountered weird behavior with private key.
It was needed for `firebase-admin`.

It seems like somewhat was not ok with `\n` special character.

## The solution

My solution is based partially on
[Ben Ilegbodu's solution](https://www.benmvp.com/blog/initializing-firebase-admin-node-sdk-env-vars/).
But the key itself also stored in Base64 encoding.

So it looks like this:

```js
const privateKey = Buffer.from(
  process.env.FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_B64,
  'base64'
).toString('utf-8')

const firebaseApp =
  global.firebaseApp ??
  admin.initializeApp({
    credential: admin.credential.cert({
      projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
      clientEmail: process.env.FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL,
      privateKey: privateKey?.replace(/\\n/gm, '\n'),
    }),
  })
```

### Why Base64

Base64 is used because well, storing on Vercel raw string with special characters
didn't work for me. ðŸ™‚

Also it's a good practice to store such data in Base64 because it's simply
a string without any special characters.

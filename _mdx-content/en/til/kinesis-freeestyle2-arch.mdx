## The problem

Some of the new owners of Kineis Freestyle2 keyboards can find that the Volume Up/Down, Mute, and Calculator buttons aren't working.

Chris Waldon had [a deep dive](https://waldon.blog/2017/10/31/kinesis-freestyle-2-and-linux-part-1-debugging/) into the problem.

He ended up with his driver, [kfreestyle2d](https://github.com/whereswaldon/kfreestyle2d).

The problem is that on some systems driver is not starting correctly.

As I found out, there are two problems:

1. Loading `uinput` kernel module
2. Tune permissions

## The solution

### Step 1: Load "uinput" kernel module

Create a systemd service, that will load the module.

Here's a config for the service, which is a config file at `/etc/systemd/system/uinput-load.service`:

```conf
[Unit]
Description=Load uinput kernel module

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/sbin/modprobe uinput

[Install]
WantedBy=sysinit.target
```

Run `systemctl enable uinput-load{:sh}` to start automatically on startup.

And let's ensure systemd will load driver after the kernel module.

Add line to the `/etc/systemd/system/kfreestyle2d.service` to the `[Unit]` section:

```conf
After=uinput-load.service
```

### Step 2: Tune permissions

Create `udev` rule at `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-uinput.rules`

With following content:

```conf
KERNEL=="uinput", MODE="0660", GROUP="uinput"
```

The group should be the same as in `/etc/systemd/system/kfreestyle2d.service`

Run `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules{:sh}`

And then just the system.

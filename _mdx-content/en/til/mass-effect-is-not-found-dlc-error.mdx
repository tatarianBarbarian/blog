## Problem

Well, I didn't know that Mass Effect(2007) had DLCs.

They are available for download [just here](https://help.ea.com/en/help/faq/dlc-for-classic-games/).

However, after installation attempt I've got an error:

"Mass Effect is not found. Please reinstall the game from original source and try again."

## The root of problem

The root of the problem is that DLC installer checks installation by looking at
windows registry keys. If they are missing, it throws an error.

Adding proper keys fixes the problem.

## Fix

1\. Go to `regedit{:sh}` with `WINEPREFIX{:sh}` set to game's wine prefix.

Usually it is `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/17460/pfx`

`WINEPREFIX=~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/17460/pfx regedit{:sh}`

OR

`protontricks 17460 regedit{:sh}`

2\. In regedit find `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -> Software -> Wow6432Node`

3\. In `Wow6432Node` create `Bioware` key, inside `Bioware` key create `Mass Effect` key.

4\. Add a string value to the key with name `Flavour`, double click on created value.
In the field "value data" write `Steam`.

5\. Add a string value to the key with name `Path`, double click on created value.
Here we need to write path to our game using Windows style. It is a tricky part.

In my case game was in `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Mass Effect/`, regedit entry was:

`Z:\home\felix\.local\share\Steam\steamapps\common\Mass Effect`

How it should look like:

6\. Next thing we need is to create another keys hierarchy:

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -> Software -> Wow6432Node -> Electronic Arts -> Electronic Arts -> Mass Effect (tm) -> ergc`.

7\. In `ergc` key set `Default` value to `5GUCXRFPQNBMTJBD3L5J`

8\. After this you can run DLC installer:

```sh
WINEPREFIX=~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/17460/pfx \
wine \
/path/to/installer.exe
```

And that's it!

Hope it will save someone's time.

## Simple solution

Error can be simply fixed by using [protontricks](https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks)
with command:

`protontricks 17460 d3dx9{:sh}`

I'm sure it's also possible with winetricks and setting right prefix.

## Plain wine solution

I ecnountered an error when tried to run Mass Effect in Steam:

`Failed to compile global shaders...`

I found
[EA forum thread on this](https://answers.ea.com/t5/Other-Mass-Effect-Games/Failed-to-compile-global-shaders/m-p/6938354/highlight/true#M8342)

But I use linux on my daily basis, so I tried to play this game under Proton.

As proton uses wine under the hood, we need to install DirectX binaries under
Wine instance.

Proton's Wine usually located near game installation.

Each game has its own Proton and Wine instances.

In my case it was at:

`~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/17460/pfx{:shell}`

`17460{:shell}` is the steam app ID.

To run Wine in certain instance we should use `WINEPREFIX{:shell}` environment variable.

In my case to install DirectX into Mass Effect's Wine instance the command was:

`WINEPREFIX=~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/17460/pfx wine ~/Downloads/DXSDK_Jun10.exe{:shell}`

And then just follow installation master.
